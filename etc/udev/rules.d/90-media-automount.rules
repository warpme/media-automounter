# Ever since early systemd-udevd merge, we are forced to use some
# hack to be able to run long lived processes from udev (which is required for 
# some filesystems that will spawn some daemon, like ntfs-3g).
# 
# udev will kill the running process and all childs after 4-5 seconds, so the
# mounting has to be done as a separate "service"

# mount the device when added
